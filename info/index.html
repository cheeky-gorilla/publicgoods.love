		<b>What are public goods?</b>
        <br><br>
		Public goods are nice things that we generally take for granted in life: public roads, parks, beaches and schools, but also websites like Wikipedia.com, free & open-source software (e.g. Linux) and even the air we breathe. Public goods by definition are "non-excludable" and "non-rivalrous", meaning no one can stop you from using it (e.g. no pay wall), and one person using it doesn't prevent another person from also using it (e.g. going to the park won't stop someone else from also going to the park). Because public goods don’t generate any revenue, they generally rely on donations, grants or government support to ensure their availability. 
		<br><br>
		<b>Ok public goods are good, so what's the problem?</b>
        <br><br>
	The problem is that there's a lack of incentives to fund public goods, even though things like clean air and water (two of the most important public goods), are vital to our survival. This incentive problem (also known as the "tragedy of the commons" or the "free-rider problem"), can be boiled down as follows: 1) why would you pay for something if no one can stop you from using it, 2) why should you pay for something when others are also using it and also not paying, and 3) why bother making a small donation, when it won’t have an impact, because it's not enough to make up for everyone who doesn't donate?
     </p>
     </div>
  <div class="column" style="background-color:#transparent;">
    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#ffffff;">
    	<b>What happens when public goods dont get funding?</b>
   		<br><br>
		Private goods end up absorbing the vast amount of talent and money in the world, leaving public goods overlooked and underfunded. This pursuit for profit leads to coordination failures such as privacy violations (companies monetizing personal data for advertising), inequality (education locked behind rising tuition fees), fake news (clickbait content), and at worst, threatens the very existence of us as a species (air pollution is a direct consequence of the way society prioritizes private goods over public goods).
      		
        <br><br>
		<b>Yep that sounds bad. What can we do about this?</b>
        <br><br>
		To break this cycle, we need new tools and mechanisms to incentivize supporting public goods, so that entrepreneurs can spend less time worrying about making money, and more time building for the public good. 
        <br><br>
	Fortunately - and unknown to most! - these tools and mechanisms are being pioneered on smart-contract blockchains like <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">Ethereum</a>, and are already being used to make a meaningful change in the world today.

		<b>What is quadratic funding?</b>
        <br><br>
		Quadratic funding has been described as "<a href="https://wtfisqf.com/" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">the mathematically optimal way to fund public goods in a democratic community</a>". 
        <br><br>
		Quadratic funding starts with raising a pool of capital (called the "matching pool") from large entities (companies, foundations, philanthropies etc.), that want to support public goods. These donors don’t know how their funds will be allocated to public good projects, just that it will be! Next, a crowdfunding campaign is started (similar to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">Kickstarter</a>), with a selection of verified public goods projects, where individuals like you and me can make donations to our preferred projects. 
		<br><br>
		Here’s where it gets interesting: each individual donation is supplemented with funds from the matching pool, with the amount of additional funding being based on *how many people* have donated to the project in question, NOT *how large* the individual donation is. This means that, the more people that donate to a given project, the more will be added from the matching pool, regardless of how much is donated. In practice, this means that projects with many small donations will receive more from the matching pool, compared to projects with just a handful of large donations. 
        <br><br>
		This funding mechanism prevents wealthy donors from unfairly dictating the allocation of the matching pool (virtue signaling), and more importantly, incentivizes small donations from individual donors, because they know that even a very small donation will lead to a potentially much larger donation. Large entities are incentivized to donate funds to the matching pool, because they can claim to support public goods without any bias, and enjoy the resulting PR boost. And, thanks to the guarantees of decentralized, smart-contract blockchains, this is all done in a completely transparent, immutable and trustless way.

    <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color:#ffffff;">
		<b>How can public goods projects use quadratic funding?</b>
		<br><br>
        Public goods projects can use quadratic funding as a way to bootstrap initial funding for whatever the project is. To take part in quadratic funding, the project will need to  apply to be listed on one of the <a href="https://www.publicgoods.love/funding/platforms/" style="color: ffffff">quadratic funding platforms</a>, and get a crypto wallet to receive donations. 
        <br><br>
		<b>How can individual donors take part in quadratic funding for public goods?</b>
		<br><br>
        At the time of writing, there are three <a href="https://www.publicgoods.love/funding/platforms/" style="color: ffffff">crowdfunding platforms</a> that use quadratic funding; <a href="https://gitcoin.co/grants/" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">Gitcoin</a>, <a href="https://clr.fund/" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">clr.fund</a> and <a href="https://pomelo.io/grants/" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">Pomelo</a>. To take part, you need a crypto wallet with funds on it. For more information, check out the aforementioned platforms' websites for specific instructions.
		<br><br>
        <b>Does quadratic funding solve public goods funding?</b>
		<br><br>
        Quadratic funding alone still ultimately relies on the generosity of donors to support public goods, and generosity can only go so far. 
If we want more support for public goods, then we need to introduce financial incentives for anyone who contributes to public goods. This is where retroactive public goods funding comes in.. Read the <a href="#RPGFFAQ" style="color: ffffff">next section</a> for more!

		<b>What is retroactive public goods funding?</b>
		<br><br>
		Today, it's difficult to make a decent living off public goods projects, which is why entrepreneurs and investors instead focus their efforts on private goods - stuff that people have to pay for. And, the rewards for successful private goods are massive: companies can make billions via IPOs or acquisitions. With financial incentives like that, private goods absorb the vast amount of talent and money in the world, leaving public goods overlooked and underfunded.
        <br><br>
		Retroactive public goods funding (RPGF) aims to flip those incentives in favor of public goods, by granting financial rewards for successfully executing a public goods projects. 
RPGF involves using a pool of capital (like the matching pool used for <a href="#QFFAQ" style="color: ffffff">quadratic funding</a>), to retroactively reward contributors to successful public goods projects. A "contributor" in this case can be anyone who donates their time or money to a public goods project; founders, investors, volunteers etc.
		<br><br>
		<b>But how would RPGF actually work?</b>
		<br><br>
		Imagine someone writes an educational "blockchain for dummies" book. By selling that book, it would become a private good, meaning the author could generate revenue from it, at the cost of reducing its reach (since not everyone would want to pay for it). If, instead, the author gives away the ebook online for free, it will likely have a far larger reach, but the author would generate no income from it. Given the choice, most rational people would choose the private good route! RPGF has the ability to change that, by rewarding entrepreneurs for making the "right" choice - the choice that aligns with the greater good. With RPGF, the author can release the book for free, enjoy the largest reach, while still receiving financial compensation. 
        <br><br>
		Now imagine the author wants to write a series of "blockchain for dummies" books, tailored to specific industries (e.g. supply chain, gaming, healthcare), but needs support to do so. The author can use blockchain-based coordination tools like decentralized autonomous organizations (<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/dao/" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">DAOs</a>), to formalize how people all over the world can coordinate to support the book series, and use programmable incentives to reward people with tokens (a form of shareholding). Tokens could be allocated for writing content, editing, research, fact checking, or just for donating funds (which can be used to pay for e.g. design). Basically, you take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">best aspects of open-source development</a>, formalize it via a DAO, and add incentive mechanisms via tokens. Once the books are finished, the DAO can vote to publish the series online for free. Assuming the book is deemed a success, all contributors - identified via their token holdings - could receive RPGF.

		The above examples are specific to the digital space, but make no mistake, this is applicable to the "real world" too. It’s possible to create a DAO dedicated to weekly beach cleanups, and reward participants with tokens for different roles (e.g. organizing the meetup, collecting trash, verifying individuals collected trash, providing refreshments etc.). The local community could setup RPGF to reward the work of such individuals.

		<b>So with RPGF, a public goods project can make money if they're successful, but what about before they achieve success?</b>
		<br><br>
RPGF also allows public goods projects - despite generating no revenue! - to be valued based on how much RPGF they're expected to receive in the future, which in turn is based on the amount of value the public good could create. Savvy investors (angels, VCs) would thus pursue investments in public goods projects that have the highest potential to do good, knowing that their token-holdings in those projects would make them eligible for RPGF if successful - similar to an IPO or acquisition. And, if those tokens are tradable in liquid exchanges, then a speculative market can exist where the tokens trade based on the expected future RPGF, providing earlier liquidity for founders and investors if needed. 
		<br><br>
		<b>But for all this to work, there needs to be significant capital available for RPGF, and where would that come from? And who makes the decision to grant RPGF?</b>
  		<br><br>
Here’s a real-world example: <a href="https://www.optimism.io/" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">Optimism</a> is an Ethereum "<a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/optimistic-rollups/#top" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">rollup</a>" that makes it cheaper for people to use Ethereum, and earns transaction fees for doing so. Optimism has <a href="https://medium.com/ethereum-optimism/retroactive-public-goods-funding-33c9b7d00f0c" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">committed all of its profits to RPGF</a>, and has donated $1m to date. Optimism has setup a DAO to manage its RPGF pool, where its members are tasked with voting on which public goods projects are eligible to be rewarded for their success, and how much they should receive. Thanks to smart-contract blockchains, when Optimism codifies its RPGF commitments, their profit will be allocated to a RPGF pool in a trustless, transparent and immutable way. This means we have assurance that, as more people are onboarded into the Ethereum ecosystem, and more people use Optimism for its cheaper fees, more money will be allocated to RPGF. 
All we need are a few more entities like Optimism to contribute a portion of their profits to RPGF, to create a powerful flywheel of incentives for entrepreneurs and investors to start focusing on public goods.
		<br><br>
		<b>At what point can RPGF actually make a difference in the world?</b>
        <br><br>
		In May 2022, it's estimated that <a href="https://medium.com/employbl/tech-startup-funding-report-may-2022-b3f34a2cacb" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">US tech startups raised almost $3 billion</a> via venture capital, private equity and debt capital, while the global IPO market raised <a href="https://www.ey.com/en_gl/ipo/trends" target="_blank" style="color: ffffff">$18 billion a month in Q1 2022</a>. It will take a lot of growth for RPGF to overtake those numbers, but as it does grow, the narrative will be incredibly powerful. If we assume that people are fundamentally good, and people suddenly have financial incentives to support public goods, then we'll naturally see a brain-drain away from private goods to public goods. 
       	<br><br>
		<b>How can public goods projects take advantage of RPGF today?</b>
        <br><br>
		At the time of writing, the only RPGF campaign being run is by Optimism. Projects should keep an eye on Optimism's social feeds for announcements about the next distribution round.
